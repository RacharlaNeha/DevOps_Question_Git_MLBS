# This is a example document

## The simple workflow is list below
- **Do NOT PUSH TO MASTER BRANCH**!!
- Every time, make yourself a new branch when you are going to work on your part.
- For each question set, we will create a new markdown document named as `ClientName-MajorFocusedTopic-yy-mm-dd.md`.
- When you done your part, push your branch to remote and make a pull request to main repo.
- All the team member will discuss and review the questions in the pull request discussion page.
- Finally, I will merge it to mater branch.

Thanks
